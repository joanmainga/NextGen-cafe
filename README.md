  #âœ¨**Creative Divergence from the Mockup**
1. Layout Enhancements:
Added rounded corners (border-radius) across all sections for a softer, modern look.
Introduced backgrounds like whitesmoke and wheat to break visual monotony.
2. Additional Elements:
Designed a community section and resources section to enrich user engagement and informational depth.
3. Visual Identity Improvements:
Used consistent padding and spacing (padding-top, margin-bottom) for better visual rhythm.
